## Unity Tutorial
I followed a beginner Unity tutorial by CodeMonkey on Youtube. I created a 2D game using some package files from CodeMonkey's website. Mostly, I used his Sprites but I deleted all the script assets so I could write the C# code from scratch myself. I wasn't able to complete the whole tutorial but I finished the basic mechanics with two game levels. It just needs music, start and end screens, and some visual polishing.
